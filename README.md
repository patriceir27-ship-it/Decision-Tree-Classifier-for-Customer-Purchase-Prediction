## Project Overview

This project is **Task 03** of my **Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The objective is to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts whether a customer will **purchase a product or service** based on their **demographic and behavioral attributes**.

The project focuses on **fast execution**, **model interpretability**, and **real-world deployment readiness**.

---

## Problem Statement

> Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank product (`yes` / `no`) using historical marketing campaign data.

- **Type**: Supervised Learning  
- **Task**: Binary Classification  
- **Target Variable**: `y` (purchase decision)

---

##  Key Features

- End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline (9 structured steps)
- Fast and interpretable **Decision Tree model**
- Handles mixed numerical & categorical data
- No feature scaling required (tree-based model)
- Deployment-ready workflow
